This was a project to implement a simple client side editor. 

The project uses codemirror v5 to implement a javascript editor in a browser. 

The implementation uses codemirror directly, so you don't need to import or do any npm setup.

To have this running do:
`git clone` and open the `index.html` file from the local clone.
